# Calculator

Website Link : https://praveenraju24.github.io/Calculator/

It is a calculator with user defined functions

I have made this calculator without using any inbuilt functions . I have using DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS.
Given expression will be converted from infix to postfix expression by using stack .Then evaluaation of postfix expression can 
be done with stack which take O(n) Time complexity , O(n+n) Space complexity.

To calculate square root i have used binary search which takes O(logn) time complexity.

permutations and combination takes O(n) times.

prime number takes O(sqrt(n)) time complexity.

I have provided all code required and website link to use as real time calculator
